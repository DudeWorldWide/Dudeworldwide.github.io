Writing is thinking on paper. Or in this case, on a screen.

I write because:

1. **Clarity** - Writing forces me to organize my thoughts
2. **Memory** - I forget things. Writing preserves ideas.
3. **Connection** - Maybe someone out there resonates with this

The act of putting words down makes fuzzy ideas concrete.

That's enough reason for me.
