### The SmartPhone...

I still remember the date June 29<sup>th</sup>, 2007...

The date when the first-ever iPhone was released, and it completely changed the way we've looked at mobile phones ever since. That keynote—it's probably one of my most-watched videos of a product launch. There's something about the way Steve Jobs said:

> "iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone."

'Revolutionary' & 'Innovative'—that's how I've always felt about Apple.

Smartphones have evolved beyond being mere tools—they're now an extension of our identity. People often choose phones that reflect their persona, and these preferences influence consumer choices, alongside functionality and utility. Devices like foldables and flip phones address this desire for personalization and are a step toward reimagining smartphone design.

Every few years, technology reaches a saturation, where advancements become incremental. This is especially true for smartphones today, which have plateaued in areas like form factors, display resolutions, and camera innovations.

We've come a long way from the days of Blackberry. Today's smartphones are no longer standalone devices; they are part of interconnected ecosystems, working seamlessly with smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables. These gadgets enable super-fast communication, high data transfer speeds, powerful cameras, LiDAR sensors, optical sensors, and more. It's hard to imagine life without a smartphone.

The progress has been astounding—real-time object erasure (with AI), image recognition, ultra-bright 1,000-nit displays, and processors that outperform PC chips have become standard features. The innovation of the last decade has been transformative.

However, in recent years, the pace of innovation has slowed. Each new smartphone release offers only incremental upgrades. While these small improvements add up to significant innovations over time, the excitement surrounding new product launches has waned. Under pressure to release new models annually, tech giants face the challenge of meeting consumer expectations in an era of stalled innovation. The recent launch of the iPhone 16 is a prime example of this dilemma. And it's not just Apple—Samsung, too, has shifted its focus from hardware upgrades to AI-driven features.

Though foldables represent a meaningful advancement, they remain premium devices, often priced for enthusiasts. They also raise the question: will companies like Apple fully embrace this design direction, especially when it could cannibalize the tablet or iPad market?

So, are we at the point where smartphones need a design overhaul? While I don't believe a complete redesign is imminent, I do think tech giants are grappling with this question. Major brands like Apple and Samsung have been cautious, but smaller players haven't hesitated to experiment. We've seen innovative designs from LG's swivel screens and OnePlus' motorized front cameras to Huawei's triple-fold smartphones. The intention is clear: push the boundaries of what a smartphone can be.

That said, I think there's still more potential to harness AI before companies commit to a full design overhaul. For major brands, it's a risky move—any misstep could damage their reputation. But can we truly innovate without taking risks? Especially when we're talking about a paradigm shift from 0 to 1.

### What's Next?

While I believe we are at a pivotal moment in smartphone design, the current focus is shifting towards software innovation, with AI taking center stage at keynote presentations. However, this doesn't eliminate the need for a hardware evolution. Products like Apple's Vision Pro, Microsoft's HoloLens, and Google Lens may well represent the next generation of smartphones.

Let's take a step back. Remember the Nokia N-series or Sony Ericsson phones with their quirky swivels, slides, and unique keyboard layouts? Back then, smartphones followed a simple design principle: a screen for output and a keyboard for input. But this changed entirely with the introduction of touchscreen smartphones. Steve Jobs' iconic iPhone keynote introduced a "smart" phone with a touchscreen at its core, revolutionizing the entire industry.

Despite significant advancements in sensors, processors, and batteries, the screen has remained the primary output device, indirectly limiting design evolution. But if the screen's main function is simply to display content, doesn't it make sense to decouple the display from the device itself? What if we had standalone devices to see, and separate devices (like our phones) that handle processing (CPU, GPU, NPU)?

### Smart Glasses

This idea isn't new. When I first learned about Microsoft's HoloLens, it felt like a glimpse of the future. While the hardware required to seamlessly integrate displays into spectacles is still in its infancy, I believe this is the road toward a new era of computing.

Until now, smartphones have been companions, but I envision a future where technology goes beyond this, augmenting reality itself. Smart glasses perfectly fit this vision. Imagine navigating a route without needing to glance at a separate device, as AR overlays real-time directions onto the world around you. Picture reading articles, watching movies, or browsing without worrying about screen size limitations. Live translations could happen before your eyes as you converse with someone from another country, or as street signs and menus in foreign languages are instantly translated.

The potential to augment reality without needing to interact with a traditional device is thrilling. It simplifies interaction and reduces steps in our daily tasks. In a world where smart glasses become your primary display, complete with inbuilt optical sensors (like iris scanners for authentication), and smartphones act as batteries and processors to power them—this future isn't far off. Apple's Vision Pro, though in its first iteration, is undoubtedly a step in this direction. With continuous improvements, it's not hard to imagine a time when smartphones, or at least their screens, evolve into wearables like smart spectacles.
