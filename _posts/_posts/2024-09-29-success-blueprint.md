**Success** means different things to different people, and it changes as we grow. What I perceived as success a few years ago is not what I'm seeking right now. And here's the catch—***this chase is endless***. You achieve something, and then you're on to the next goal, always reaching for more.

Although success can't be precisely defined, we often measure it by things like money, fame, or freedom. Sure, money gives us freedom—the freedom to pursue passions, or maybe even take an endless holiday. But it's no substitute for the finer aspects of life like meaningful relationships or a fulfilling family life. 

In the myriad ways we define success, there's one constant we all crave: ***motivation***. That inner spark. The force that keeps us on track, pushing forward with the hope of becoming successful one day.

### What is Motivation?

Wikipedia sums it up pretty well:

> "Motivation is an internal state that propels individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often understood as a force that explains why people or animals initiate, continue, or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time."

It's ***that force*** we seek when we feel lost. It's the energy that fuels the never-ending pursuit of success.

We turn to idols, interviews, motivational videos, and the infamous self-help books, all in search of that elusive spark.

I'm no exception. I devoured self-help books, believing they held the key—the blueprint to success. I thought they had cracked some sort of secret code, a formula that, if I followed, would guarantee the success I was chasing. 

I'm sure you've felt the same. We look to successful people as mentors, hoping to imitate their journey, believing that if we replicate their steps, we'll reach the same destination. But here's the truth: ***everyone's journey is different. What worked for them might not work for you or me***.

Each of us is shaped by unique circumstances, perspectives, responsibilities, and support systems. ***There is no one-size-fits-all blueprint***.

### The Moment of Realization...

I'll be honest. I, too, chased that blueprint - hoping for a revelation. But after reading enough, I realized something: ***no two books offered the same perspective, and often they even contradicted each other***. Confused and frustrated, I stopped reading them altogether.

I stopped consuming the motivational quotes, the Instagram posts with pictures of lions and sports cars. And I shifted to fiction, letting go of the idea that there was a singular path to success.

While there's no magic code for success, one day it hit me—there are certain things that can help us become the person we want to be, or at least, help us understand what has shaped who we are today.

I began with the questions, **"What defines you?"** and **"Who are you—the present you?"** Because, **if I could understand who I am today and what has shaped me over the years, I could surely start becoming the person I want to be**.

>1. Who Are You? What Defines the Present You?
>2. What Shaped You to Become the Present You?
>3. If Past Actions Shaped the Present You, How Can You Shape the Future You?

### 1. Defining Yourself

**So, who are you? What defines the person you are today?**

After much reflection, I distilled it down to a few questions that helped me understand the 'present me.' These might help you too:

* What is your self-image?
* What are your beliefs and principles?
* How do you approach problems and life?
* What are your strengths? Your weaknesses?
* What's on your autopilot—your habits?
* How do you behave in your everyday life?
* What perspective do you bring to the world?
* What moral compass guides your decisions?

Take a moment to think about these.

Your **self-image** reflects how you see yourself deep down, the voice within that subconsciously directs your actions. Your **belief system**—your principles, your sense of right and wrong—shapes your decisions and reactions to the world around you. And most of us live on autopilot, with our behaviors shaped by unconscious habits developed over time.

Everyday actions repeated without conscious thought become habits, and habits turn into behaviors. Eventually, these behaviors mold your self-image, reinforcing the autopilot you operate on.

### 2. How Did We Get Here?

These behaviors, beliefs, and habits didn't just appear out of nowhere. They were shaped by:

* Your past actions and experiences
* Major life events
* The lessons and takeaways you've internalized from those moments

Your brain collects and catalogs these experiences as 'proof' of who you are, shaping the self-image and autopilot you operate on today.

And here's the powerful part: if your present self is shaped by past actions, then the choices you make today will shape the future version of you. If you can consciously act on who you are today, you can create a different future.

### 3. Shaping Your Future Self

While external factors—like life events and chance encounters—play a role, you control the internal factors that truly shape you. 

The external world may be unpredictable, but you can choose how you respond to it and consciously shape certain influences in your life, like:

* The people you surround yourself with
* The content you consume
* The mentors you seek

And as for the internal factors? Focus on:

* Your mindset
* Your mental and physical health
* Your natural talents
* Your academic and professional skills
* Your actions today

### A Blueprint, But Not the One You Expected

So while I set out looking for a ready-made blueprint to success, I found something better: the realization that *you* create the blueprint, day by day, decision by decision. It's not a formula handed down from someone else. It's the conscious choices you make today, the habits you form, the mindset you nurture, and the actions you take that will ultimately shape the future version of you.

Success may be a moving target, but the journey is yours to define.
